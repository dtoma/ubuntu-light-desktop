# ubuntu-light-desktop

The goal is to start from an Ubuntu-server ISO, and install the bare minimum required for a desktop environment:

- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)
- [lightdm](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM)
- [feh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/feh)
- [compton](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton)

This setup is currently in use on a Intel NUC6i5SYK.
